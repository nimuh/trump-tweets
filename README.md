# Twitter on Trump
Twitter has become one of the largest social media platforms and has millions have people using it on a daily basis. One of these users is our current president, Donald Trump. Given the degree to which the POTUS makes use of this platform it can make one wonder what other users are saying about him. This project aims to explore a sample of tweets to understand what people are saying about Trump.

# Tweets By Location
The first portion of this project looked at what people were saying depending on their location. The tweets are filtered to contain only users from the United States. All tweets are then grouped by state and each state is given its own topic model. With a topic model for each state the topics discussed in each group of tweets is extracted. 

# Types of Users
The second portion of this project aims to try to understand who the users are that sent tweets to Trump. The data pulled from Twitter comes with a feature that contains user information. The unique users are determined and then each of these user's twitter bios are clustered and then visualized in two dimensions by using t-SNE.
