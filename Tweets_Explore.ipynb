    "### Topic Modeling Results\n",
    "The ideal result from the topic modeling would be that we could see what each state was mainly talking about when tweeting about Donald Trump. The actual results are not ideal though. For each state we can look at the topics and the top 3 key words contributing to each topic. Some states are a little more obvious as to what the topics are. For example, looking at \"tn\" (Tennesee) we see \"tax returns\", \"president maga\", and \"maga rt\". \"rt\" typically stands for \"re-tweet\" in Twitter. It could be that users in Tenessee are more supportive of Trump due to these keywords being the most weighted in the overall composition of the topic. Another state that had some interesting results was \"mi\" (Michigan) where we see words like \"foreign slave\" being a top keyword for one topic but also seeing \"lib goofs\" for a separate topic. \"lib\" seems to stand for liberal, thus that topic may be against liberal agendas. A more obvious state was \"in\" (Indiana) where we see \"lyin donnie\" the top keyword for each topic among others such as \"crooked donnie\". Overall, this sample of tweets at Donald Trump can give some insight into which states' twitter users are more for or against Trump."

Under label 2 seems to be also a variety of bios but shorter in length. Overall the users seem to be all over the place for this sample and it is difficult to make any conclusions about the \"type\" of user that could send tweets to Trump. Everyone seems to have something to say."

    "## In Conclusion...\n",
    "The results here provide a little insight into users who tweet about Trump. The biggest issue is the relatively small sample size; the original data pulled contained 40k tweets and after cleaning the tweets resulted in only about 27k tweets distributed over 10k users. This sample size may not be sufficient to get any real insight, especially when doing clustering. The other thing to mention is how the bag of words approach for the clustering does not take into consideration word positioning and simply taking into account word frequencies may not be enough to get a sense of who the users are when looking at their twitter bios. The topic modeling was more promising as to seeing how users from specific states feel towards Trump, but many state models did not find good keywords for the topics so it becomes difficult to determine the mindset in those places. With more samples distributed more evenly across each state could result in more promising and interpretable topics. The other thing to consider is that not everyone uses Twitter so obtaining a good idea of how people feel towards Trump is difficult. The older generations most likely are not using social media as heavily as the younger ones, and some states are not as full of \"tech\" users like California. It would be wise, and interesting, to see if social media data and other data that could capture people's opinions on Trump could be combined to obtain a better idea of what topics people are bringing up about the current \"president\"."
